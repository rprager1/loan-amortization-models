## Loan Amortization & Mortgage Modeling
This project studies the mathematics of loan repayment under periodic compounding.
It derives closed-form formulas for fixed-payment loans and applies them to model
mortgage repayment schedules, including adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs).

### Key Contributions
- Derived installment payment formulas for loans with periodic compounding
- Computed principal and interest components for each payment period
- Modeled adjustable-rate mortgages by re-amortizing remaining balances under
  changing interest rates
- Implemented numerical calculations and visualizations in Python

### Tools & Concepts
- Python
- LaTex
- Financial mathematics
- Interest rate modeling
- Loan amortization
